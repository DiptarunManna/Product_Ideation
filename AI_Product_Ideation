                                                              AgroMind:An AI Based Plant Disease Detection App



Abstract
This application uses Machine Learning & Computer Vision to identify plant leaf disease from images, giving users real-time diagnosis and treatment advice. Farmers will be able to scan plants with their phone camera or upload photos through a web interface, and the app will examine symptoms through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based AI model learned from various plant disease datasets. Suitable remedies, both organic and chemical, will be recommended by the system, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and prevents crop losses by allowing farmers and small  businesses to provide timely treatment.

By utilizing image recognition and machine learning algorithms, AgroMind is capable of analysing a tree’s health condition through the images of its leaves , stems and such. The application also offers small and medium-sized companies meet export quality standards and stay competitive by using AI-driven precision farming techniques by providing data-driven insighta on currect plant health trends over time. Which in turn also helps them optimize resource allocation (water, fertilizers, pesticides) cutting input expenses and improve crop yield and quality, leading to higher market value.


1.0		Problem Statement
Global food security as determined by the balance of global food production and demand has become an important international issue in recent years and caused a increase in food prices in recent years. It was estimated that the demand for food will continue to increase for another 40 years due to the continuous increase in human population. The projections also indicate that an additional70% of food production is required by 2050 to meet the needs which can lead to political and economic instability in some developing countries.
Diseases in the cultivated plants reduce a significant portion of the output. This prompts attention to be paid to efficient methods of plant disease detection. Farmers are quite concerned about the presence of many plant diseases. Because they cause significant damage to the entire food supply, plant diseases pose a serious threat to small-scale farmers. Early identification of the type of plant disease present is necessary to provide efficient techniques for detection and destruction avoidance. Significant efforts have recently been made to identify plant diseases that impact a variety of crops and are found throughout the world. There is a lot of study being done to identify the factors that cause these diseases. Some of the diseases are marked by the presence of viruses while some are resultant of fungal infection. This becomes a major issue when the causing factor is not traceable before it has already spread to major production section.

This paper address this by integrating AI with real-world agricultural needs. This app empowers small and medium-scale farmers with cutting-edge technology, reducing dependency on manual inspection while improving crop health, yield, and sustainability. This report outlines the problem statement, market need, business model, product design, and technical framework required to develop and implement this innovative AI solution.
